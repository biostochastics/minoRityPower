author: "minoRityPower Package"

# Introduction

The minoRityPower package provides tools for estimating statistical power when evaluating healthcare system-level interventions designed to accelerate clinical trial enrollment among minority participants. Developed for the ARPA-H program application, this package offers two complementary approaches:

1. Facility-level analysis examining enrollment rates
2. Participant-level analysis modeling enrollment probabilities with minority interaction effects

# Package Overview

## Two Analysis Approaches

### Facility-Level Analysis
Models enrollment rates using negative binomial mixed-effects models to detect intervention effects on facility recruitment capacity. This approach:
- Accounts for facility-level random effects
- Models enrollment counts directly
- Assesses system-level changes in recruitment capacity
- Uses empirically-derived variance components

### Participant-Level Analysis
Models individual enrollment probabilities using logistic mixed-effects models to examine intervention effects on minority recruitment. This approach:
- Tests interaction effects between interventions and minority status
- Accounts for clustering within facilities
- Allows specification of expected minority enrollment rates
- Provides insight into differential intervention effects

# Example Usage

## Getting Started
```r
library(minoRityPower)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Facility-Level Analysis Example

First, let's examine power for detecting facility-level enrollment rate changes:
```r
# Basic facility analysis
results_facility <- run_power_facility(
  effect_sizes = c(1.25, 1.50),   # Testing 25% and 50% increases
  Ns = c(30, 45, 60),             # Various facility counts
  tau2_facility = 0.64,           # Facility-level variance
  mean_rate = 11,                 # Average monthly enrollment
  R_boot = 1000                   # Bootstrap iterations
)
```

## Participant-Level Analysis Example

Next, we'll analyze power for detecting differential effects among minority participants:
```r
# Participant-level analysis
results_participant <- run_power_participant(
  effect_sizes1 = c(1.25, 1.50),    # Main intervention effects
  effect_sizes2 = c(1.75, 2.00),    # Minority interaction effects
  Ns = c(30, 45, 60),               # Facility counts
  minority_rate = 0.3,              # Expected minority enrollment
  R_boot = 1000                     # Bootstrap iterations
)
```

# Interpreting Results

## Power Tables
The package produces power tables showing:
- Power estimates across effect sizes and sample sizes
- Convergence rates for model fitting
- Results at multiple significance levels (0.05, 0.01, 0.005)

## Visualization
Power plots display:
- Power curves across sample sizes
- Separate panels for effect size combinations
- Horizontal reference line at 80% power
- Clear labeling of minority and main effects

# Advanced Usage

## Parameter Selection

When planning your analysis:

1. Facility-Level Parameters:
   - tau2_facility: Facility-level variance (default: 0.64)
   - mean_rate: Average monthly enrollment (default: 11)

2. Participant-Level Parameters: #assumes 25% dropout rate
   - tau2_trial: Trial-level variance (default: 1.19)
   - minority_rate: Expected proportion of minority participants
   - effect_sizes2: Minority-specific intervention effects

## Computational Considerations

For reliable results:
- Use at least 1000 bootstrap iterations
- Consider parallel processing for large simulations
- Monitor convergence rates
- Save results to examine later

# Best Practices

1. Start with a small test run:
   - Use fewer effect sizes and sample sizes
   - Reduce bootstrap iterations
   - Verify output structure

2. For full analysis:
   - Include realistic effect sizes
   - Use adequate sample sizes
   - Run sufficient bootstrap iterations
   - Save results to files

3. When interpreting results:
   - Consider both statistical and practical significance
   - Examine convergence rates
   - Look at both main and interaction effects
   - Compare facility and participant-level results

# Conclusion

minoRityPower package provides a simple tool for power analysis in healthcare system interventions aimed at improving minority enrollment in clinical trials. By considering both facility and participant-level effects, researchers can better plan and evaluate intervention studies.
